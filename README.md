Memory Color Clicker
==============================================

This is a simple memory game I built for my full-stack coding bootcamp. It was built with React, which it uses it to serve up front-end content and manipulate the DOM. The game is built primarily around one stateful app component that keeps track of user clicks, user score and high score, and the position of content on the page which needs to be re-rendered every time the user clicks. 

## üîë How to Use the App:

Simple as this memory game is, it isn't quite so easy as it seems. Try to click on each of the colors exactly 1 time, for a maximum high score of 12 points. The problem is, each time you click a color, the positions of each color will be mixed up, so you'll really have to remember which colors you've clicked on. Some of the colors are preeeeetty similar too, so hopefully your memory is good...

## üìÅ Deployment Instructions

Deployed version of the app can be found [here](DEPLOYED LINK HERE). To run this app on your machine, follow these instructions. Further options for running the app yourself can also be found in the ReadMe under the my-app section. 

1. Clone this repository down to your machine.
   
2. You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in order to continue. 
   
3. Enter `npm install` in your command line after navigating into the root directory, which will install the dependencies listed in the package.json.
   
4. Enter `npm start`, which will start the app on http://localhost:3000. More options for running the app below.
   
5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser, or ctrl-click the link that will be logged to your console. Enjoy!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
