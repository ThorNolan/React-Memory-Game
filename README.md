Memory Color Clicker
==============================================

This is a simple memory game I built for my full-stack coding bootcamp. It was built with React, which it uses it to serve up front-end content and manipulate the DOM. The game is built primarily around one stateful app component that keeps track of user clicks, user score and high score, and the position of content on the page which needs to be re-rendered every time the user clicks.

## üîë How to Use the App:

Simple as this memory game is, it isn't quite so easy as it seems. Try to click on each of the colors exactly 1 time, for a maximum high score of 12 points. The problem is, each time you click a color, the positions of each color will be mixed up, so you'll really have to remember which colors you've clicked on. Some of the colors are pretty similar too, so hopefully you have a good memory üòâ
